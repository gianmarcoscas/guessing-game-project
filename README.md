# guessing-game-project

# Purpose of the project
The project focuses on creating a game in which the user tries to guess a number chosen by the computer. As soon as the user selects a range of numbers, specifies a maximum number of attempts, and makes a guess regarding the number "thought up" by the computer, the program will reply with a set of answers based on the situation: too low, too high, or correct. If the user guesses correctly, the program will stop its operations; otherwise, it will continue until the number of attempts is exhausted or the user makes a voluntary choice to quit the game.
